## General info
* The final objective is to have a script able to deliver the efficiency value for a certain electric motor working on a specific torque and speed/rpm.
* This is necessary for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Reinforcement Learning optimization.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
* Plain Python and some of its specialized lybraries

## Setup
* Keep the scripts and files in the same folder.

## Code Examples
Show examples of usage:
* no code yet

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* no feature yet.

To-do list:
* Understand the EM model.
* Efficiency is computed based on regression => we need a function to implement the regressor so efficiency could be delivered continuously across speed     and torque ranges.


## Status
* Project is: _in progress.
