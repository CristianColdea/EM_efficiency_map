## General info
The final objective is to have a script able to deliver the efficiency value for a certain electric motor working on a specific torque and speed/rpm.
This is necessary for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Reinforcement Learning optimization.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
* Plain Python and its specialized lybraries

## Setup
Keep the scripts and files in the same folder.

## Code Examples

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* no feature yet.

To-do list:
* Understand the EM model.
* Generate three interdependent value lists: EM speed/rpm, torque and efficiency.
* Code an interpolation function for the values not covered within the lists, so efficiency could be delivered continuously across speed and torque ranges.
