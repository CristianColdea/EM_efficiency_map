# Electric Motor (EM) efficiency map model
> This is a project for model the electric motor efficiency map based on a published scientific paper.
> The final objective is to have a script able to deliver the efficiency value for a certain electric motor working on a specific torque and speed/rpm.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Awesome feature 1
* Awesome feature 2
* Awesome feature 3

To-do list:
* Understand the EM model.
* Generate three interdependent value lists: EM speed/rpm, torque and efficiency.
* Code an interpolation function for the values not covered within the lists, so efficiency could be delivered continuously across speed and torque ranges.
